# find-circuit

Python code for finding circuits with a given truth table.

## Implementation

There are currently two implementations:
- A naive bruteforce algorithm without any dependencies.
- A solver that uses Z3.

## Features

- Multiple inputs
- Multiple outputs
- Multiple gates with different value (bruteforce)

## Prerequisites

- `python3`
- `z3-solver` (optional)

## Usage

See `example-*.py`
